title: A Tale of Two Cities
category: blog
---
In less than three weeks I will be moving from Kansas City to Chicago.  While I grew up in the Chicago
area for most of my life, over the past two years I have gradually started to call KC home.  I've made
many great friends here; I've been a part of an amazing church where I've been growing and serving;
I've been really enjoying my job and the smart people I get to work with.  If I was given the choice
to rewind the past two years and do things differently, I'm not sure if I could plan things out any
better than it has been.

It's a strange feeling then to be on the cusp of leaving what in the present feels like home to return
to a place in which home is a fading memory.  Waves of nostalgia and sadness and excitement.

Looking forward, I'm excited to be closer to my family and friends living in Chicago.  I'm pumped
about living near the city and I'm optimistic about finding a new church and getting to meet new
people.  I'm also looking forward to my new job as a software consultant at Clarity--which hopefully
I will get a chance to blog more about in the future.

As I prepare myself to leave this city for another, in the swirling torrent of anticipation and uncertainty,
I find great solace and hope knowing that the purposes of God will always prevail in my life and in
the world, just as they did two-thousand years ago on an Easter morning.

>    Many are the plans in the mind of a man,
		but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand.
(Proverbs 19:21 ESV)
